# Elevation

## Introduction

> We are provided with a working application that searches a raster of elevation data for regions of relative flatness. The raster is an image in which each pixel represents an elevation for a point on the terrain. The application can be imagined to be searching for potential landing sites for an aircraft or spacecraft of some kind.
rgbelevation contains example images to use with the program
